<p>It was many and many a year ago,<br /> 
In a kingdom by the sea <br />
That a maiden there lived whom you may know. <br />
By the name of Annabel Lee; <br />
And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br />
Than to love and be loved by me.</p>
<br />
<p>I was a child and she was a child, <br />
In this kingdom by the sea; <br />
But we loved with a love that was more than love<br />
I and my Annabel Lee <br />
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven <br />
Coveted her and me.</p>
<br />
<p>And this is the reason that, long ago, <br />
In this kingdom by the sea, <br />
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling <br />
My beautiful Annabel Lee; <br />
So that her highborn kinsmen came <br />
And bore her away from me, <br />
To shut her up in a sepulchre <br />
In this kingdom by the sea.</p>
<br />
<p>The angels, not half so happy in heaven, <br />
Went envying her and me<br />
Yes! that was the reason (as all men know, <br />
In this kingdom by the sea) <br />
That the wind came out of the cloud by night, <br />
chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>
<br />
<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br />
Of those who were older than we <br />
Of many far wiser than we<br />
And neither the angels in heaven above, <br />
Nor the demons down under the sea, <br />
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br />
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</p>
<br />
<p>The angels, not half so happy in heaven, <br />
Went envying her and me <br />
Yes! That was the reason (as all men know,<br /> 
In this kingdom by the sea) <br />
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br /> 
chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>
