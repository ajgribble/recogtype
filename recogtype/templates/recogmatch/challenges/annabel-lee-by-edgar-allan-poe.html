    <li>It was many and many a year ago,<br /> 
    In a kingdom by the sea, <br />
    That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br />
    By the name of Annabel Lee; <br />
    And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br />
    Than to love and be loved by me.</li>
    
    <li>I was a child and she was a child, <br />
    In this kingdom by the sea: <br />
    But we loved with a love that was more than love<br />
    I and my Annabel Lee; <br />
    With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven <br />
    Coveted her and me.</li>
    
    <li>And this is the reason that, long ago, <br />
    In this kingdom by the sea, <br />
    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling <br />
    My beautiful Annabel Lee; <br />
    So that her highborn kinsmen came <br />
    And bore her away from me, <br />
    To shut her up in a sepulchre <br />
    In this kingdom by the sea.</li>
    
    <li>The angels, not half so happy in heaven, <br />
    Went envying her and me<br />
    Yes! that was the reason (as all men know, <br />
    In this kingdom by the sea) <br />
    That the wind came out of the cloud by night, <br />
    chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</li>
    
    <li>But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br />
    Of those who were older than we <br />
    Of many far wiser than we<br />
    And neither the angels in heaven above, <br />
    Nor the demons down under the sea, <br />
    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br />
    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</li>
    
    <li>The angels, not half so happy in heaven, <br />
    Went envying her and me <br />
    Yes! That was the reason (as all men know,<br /> 
    In this kingdom by the sea) <br />
    That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br /> 
    chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</li>
