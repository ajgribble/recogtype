<h2>Welcome to RecogType!</h2><br />
<h3>What is RecogType?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>The short anwer is RecogType is a data collection and recognition 
system created to support my MSc thesis at the University of Kent. The 
theme of my thesis is "Keystroke Dynamics as a Biometric" which basically
means "recognizing a user by how they type".</p></div><br />

<h3>Who can use RecogType?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>As long as you are 18 or older you can use RecogType! No matter your
typing style or skill you are welcome to join in the study.</p></div><br />

<h3>What are my responsibilities as a user?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>As a user, you will be challenged to type on your keyboard as you normally 
would but in different scenarios. For example, one challenge may ask you to
 simply type an excerpt of a book that has been provided to you. Another 
challenge may be to type up a mock email to a friend. The goal is to get 
you typing and extract your typing data.</p></div><br />

<h3>What do you do with my data?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>Whenever you supply us with your keystroke data it is immediately and securely
saved in our project database. Your keystroke information is then studied 
to find out how accurately we can model your typing style and how unique your 
typing style is to you.</p></div><br />

<h3>How long will you keep my data for?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>Your account information will be kept until the end of this project, which 
concludes in mid-September, no matter what. Your keystroke information will be kept until the 
end of the research project as well.</p></div><br />

<h3>Who will have access to my data?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>Your data will only be directly used by myself and my 
overseeing advisor. Trusted 3rd parties, such as those servicing the 
system in the case of an unforseen issue out of our control, 
may also obtain access after explicit permission.</p></div><br />

<h3>How can I withdraw from the study?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>If you've created an account and decided you would like to opt out 
that is not a problem. Simply email me at **email here** and it will 
be taken care of immediately. Whether you've completed 20 
challenges or just recently created an account your information will 
be wiped clean and your account removed from our system.</p></div><br />

<h3>Where Can I Learn More?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>Within the navigation bar at the top you can find a link to the FAQs
page which will delve deeper into the project and give you, the user, the
ability to email me with other questions you may have. This project also 
aims to enlighten the user community on the technologies it is built-on 
so the more questions the better!</p></div><br />

<h3>I'm Ready to Join! So...How?</h3>
<div class="text_row"><p>Within the navigation bar at the top is the registration link. Simply
follow it to the registration page and you'll be on your way to 
understanding a technology that may prove to revolutionize the way your 
computer is protected from unauthorized users!</p></div><br />
