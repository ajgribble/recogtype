        <li>RecogType is officially open to the public! I would like to thank 
        those who have helped with testing. Those of you who helped
        should now notice you are able to test the system as well as train.
        Please remember, RecogType is still a 
        prototype and has a long way to go. If you run into any bugs, issues or 
        have any questions please email me at 
        <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}javascript/secure_email.js" type="text/javascript">
        </script>, your feedback is always welcomed.
        </li>
        <li>I would like to stress the fact that RecogType is still unstable 
        for recognizing users accurately. This is due to the fact that enough 
        data has not yet been collected for testing purposes. With that said, 
        PLEASE DO NOT FOCUS TOO MUCH ON YOUR SYSTEM TESTING RESULTS AT THIS TIME; 
        they are mostly there for display purposes while we continue to collect 
        keystrokes and test different systems.</li>
        <li>Planned features not yet working:
            <ul class="inner">
                <li>Accurate Recognition on the Back End</li>

<h3>Some common Q&A before you register:</h3>

<a href="#" class="expander">What is RecogType?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>The short answer is that RecogType is a prototype for a 
    data collection and recognition system created to support my MSc thesis 
    at the University of Kent. The title of my thesis is "An Online Evaluation 
    Platform for Keystroke Dynamics Backed Recognition" which basically means 
    my goal was to create an online system that can be reused no matter how
    recognition is done on the back-end but data will always be collected the same 
    on the front.</p></div>

<a href="#" class="expander">Who can use RecogType?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>As long as you are 18 or older you can use RecogType! 
    No matter your typing style or skill you are welcome to join in the 
    study.</p></div>

<a href="#" class="expander">What are my responsibilities as a user?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>As a user, you will be challenged to type on your 
    keyboard as you normally would but in different scenarios. For example, 
    one challenge may ask you to simply type an excerpt of a book that has 
    been provided to you. Another challenge may be to type up a mock email to 
    a friend. The goal is to get you typing naturally and extract your 
    data.</p></div>

<a href="#" class="expander">What do you do with my data?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>Whenever you supply us with your keystroke data it 
    is immediately and securely saved in our project database. Your keystroke 
    information is then studied to find out how accurately we can model your 
    typing style and how unique your typing style is to you.</p></div>

<a href="#" class="expander">How long will you keep my data for?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>Your account information will be kept until the end 
    of this project, which concludes in mid-September, no matter what. Your 
    keystroke information will be kept until the end of the research project as
    well. There may be the possibility that future research is conducted on the
    data provided, in this case you will be given the option whether or not to 
    allow us to retain your data. If you allow us to retain your data it will 
    be stripped of your email, password and first name making it 100% 
    anonymous.</p></div>

<a href="#" class="expander">How can I withdraw from the study?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>If you've created an account and decided you would 
    like to opt out that is not a problem. Simply email me at
    <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}javascript/secure_email.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    and it will be taken care of immediately. Whether you've completed 20 
    challenges or just recently created an account your information will 
    be wiped clean and your account removed from our system.</p></div>

<a href="#" class="expander">Where Can I Learn More?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>Within the navigation bar at the top you can find a 
    link to the FAQs page which will delve deeper into the project and give 
    you, the user, the ability to email me with other questions you may have. 
    This project also aims to enlighten the user community on the technologies 
    it is built-on so the more questions the better!</p></div>

<a href="#" class="expander">I'm Ready to Join! So...How?</a>
<div class="expandable"><p>Within the navigation bar at the top is the 
    registration link. Simply follow it to the registration page and you'll 
    be on your way to helping research a technology that may prove to 
    revolutionize the way your computer is protected from unauthorized 
    users!</p></div>
