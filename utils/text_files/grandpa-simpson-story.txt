We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is 
to tell them stories that don't go anywhere. Like the time I caught the 
ferry over to Shelbville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided 
to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. 
So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to 
take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of 
bumblebees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter" they'd say!
Now where were we...oh yes, the important thing was, that I had an 
onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white 
onions, because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big 
yellow ones...
