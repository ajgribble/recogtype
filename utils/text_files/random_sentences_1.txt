The color of grass is green.
The color of the sky is blue. 
Hearts, both in and out are red.
A first place medal is gold.
Yellow flower, that's for you
And I get chocolate, it is brown.
Over time we are young, then turn old.
By the time we are eighteen, we may already have many debts.
For most new dollars pay for interest on old.
Was she his or was he hers?
At what point is it said that it is too late?
Which one will be found in public?
May today be the day!
When and where can I meet you in your country?
But I may still have interest there!
